# Insider-Threat-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-
Insider threat is becoming a significant security challenge for many organizations. As the 2022 Cost of Insider Threats: Global Report reveals,insider threat incidents have risen 44% over the past two years, with costs per incident up more than a third to $15.38 million. Several learning models have been developed such as machine learning which are good at identifying threats but advanced approaches such as deep learning are promising as it offers high-quality results.
In this project, we utilized the CMU CERT r4.2 dataset, focusing on three specific CSV files: device, file, and logon. We implemented an LSTM algorithm for binary classification to predict whether a particular employee poses a threat to the organization. The prediction criteria included activities such as logging into the system after work hours and connecting external devices to transfer important files. This algorithm achieved an accuracy of approximately 95-98%.
